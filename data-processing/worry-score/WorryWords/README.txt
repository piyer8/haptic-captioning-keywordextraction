I. GENERAL DESCRIPTION
----------------------

The NRC WorryWords Lexicon is a list of over 44,000 English words and real-valued scores
indicating their associations with anxiety. The scores were obtained from manual 
annotations through crowdsourcing.

This work was approved by the NRC Research Ethics Board (NRC-REB).  REB review seeks to
ensure that research projects involving humans as participants meet Canadian standards of
ethics.

Companion lexicons -- the NRC Emotion Lexicon and the NRC VAD Lexicon are available here:
http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/lexicons.html

Applications: The lexicon has a broad range of applications in Computational Linguistics,
Psychology, Digital Humanities, Computational Social Sciences, and beyond. Notably it can
be used for:

-  Understanding anxiety and the underlying mechanisms; how anxiety relates to other
emotions; how it relates to our body; how anxiety changes with age, socio-economic status,
weather, green spaces, etc. 

- Determining how anxiety manifests in language; how language shapes anxiety; how culture
shapes the language of anxiety; etc.

- Tracking the degree of anxiety towards targets of interest such as climate change,
government policies, biological vectors, etc. 

- Identifying effective coping mechanisms and clinical interventions to manage anxiety.

- Developing automatic systems for detecting anxiety; developing chat systems that are
sensitive to nuances and diverse expressions of anxiety by people from various
demographics.

- Studying anxiety and uneasiness in story telling; its relationship with central elements
of narratology such as conflict and resilience.

- Studying how anxiety impacts social behaviour in physical and virtual environments.

III. PYTHON CODE TO ANALYZE EMOTIONS IN TEXT
--------------------------------------------

There are many third party software packages that can be used in conjunction with the NRC
Emotion Lexicon to analyze emotion word use in text. We recommend Emotion Dynamics:

	https://github.com/Priya22/EmotionDynamics

It is the primary package that we use to analyze text using the NRC Emotion Lexicon and
the NRC VAD Lexicon.  It can be used to generate a csv file with a number of emotion
features pertaining to the text of interest, including metrics of utterance emotion
dynamics. 

See this paper for an example of the use of the lexicon to analyze emotions in text:

	Vishnubhotla and Saif M. Mohammad. In Proceedings of the 13th Language Resources and
	Evaluation Conference (LREC-2022), May 2022, Marseille, France.

IV. NRC WORRYWORDS LEXICON IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES (to come in November 2024)
-----------------------------------------------

The NRC WorryWords Lexicon has anxiety annotations for English words. Despite some cultural
differences, it has been shown that a majority of emotional norms are stable across
languages. Thus, we provide versions of the lexicon in over 100 languages by translating
the English terms using Google Translate (November 2024).

The lexicon is thus available for English and these languages:

Afrikaans, Albanian, Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Basque, Belarusian, Bengali,
Bosnian, Bulgarian, Burmese, Catalan, Cebuano, Chichewa, Corsican, Croatian, Czech,
Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Estonian, Filipino, Finnish, French, Frisian, Gaelic, Galician,
Georgian, German, Greek, Gujarati, HaitianCreole, Hausa, Hawaiian, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong,
Hungarian, Icelandic, Igbo, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Javanese, Kannada,
Kazakh, Khmer, Kinyarwanda, Korean, Kurmanji, Kyrgyz, Lao, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian,
Luxembourgish, Macedonian, Malagasy, Malay, Malayalam, Maltese, Maori, Marathi, Mongolian,
Nepali, Norwegian, Odia, Pashto, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian,
Samoan, Sanskrit, Serbian, Sesotho, Shona, Simplified, Sindhi, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian,
Somali, Spanish, Sundanese, Swahili, Swedish, Tajik, Tamil, Tatar, Telugu, Thai,
Traditional, Turkish, Turkmen, Ukranian, Urdu, Uyghur, Uzbek, Vietnamese, Welsh, Xhosa,
Yiddish, Yoruba, Zulu

Note some of the translations may be incorrect or they may simply be transliterations of 
the original English terms.


V. LEMMATIZATION AND OTHER TECHNIQUES THAT MAY BE BENEFICIAL
------------------------------------------------------------

The lexicon file can be used as is, but occasionally certain additional techniques can be
applied to make the most of it for one's specific application context.

1. LEMMATIZATION: The lexicon largely includes the base forms or lemmas of words. For
example, it may include an entry for 'attack', but not for 'attacks' or 'attacking'. In
many cases, such morphological variants are expected to have similar emotion scores. So
one can first apply a third-party lemmatizer on the target text to determine the base forms
before applying the lexicon. Note that lemmatization must be applied with care; for
example, while it it good to go from 'helplessness' to 'helpless' (they are expected to
have similar emotional connotations), 'helplessness' should not be lemmatized to 'help'
(they are expected to have markedly different emotional connotations). Further, various
factors such as tense and 'differing predominant senses for different morphological forms'
can impact emotionality. So benefits of lemmatization are limited, especially when
analyzing large pieces of text.

2. OTHER: Other techniques such discarding highly ambiguous terms (terms with many
meanings), or identifying most common terms in one's text and inspecting emotion entries
in the lexicon for those terms (and correcting entries where appropriate), etc. are also
good practice.


VI. FORMS OF THE LEXICON, FILES, AND FORMAT 
-------------------------------------------

1. worrywords-v1.txt: This is the primary lexicon file. 

Each line has the following format:
Term<tab>Mean<tab>MajorityLabel<tab>MajorityLabelRatio<tab>NumberAnnotations<tab>SetOfLabels

Term: a word or phrase for which the anxiety association is provided.

Mean: real-valued score indicating the degree of anxiety association. It can range from
      -3 (maximum calmness) to 3 (maximum anxiety).
      It is the average of the anxiety scores provided by the annotators.

OrdinalClass: A discrete class assigned to the word based on the mean.
      The class is one of the following:
             3: very anxious (when mean >= 2.5)
             2: moderately anxious (when mean >= 1.5 and < 2.5)
             1: slightly anxious (when mean >= 0.5 and < 1.5) 
             0: not associated with feeling anxious or calm (when mean > -0.5 and < 0.5) 
            -1: slightly calm (when mean > -1.5 and <= -0.5)
            -2: moderately calm (when mean > -2.5 and <= -1.5)
            -3: very calm (when mean <= -2.5)

MajorityLabel: This is the most common discrete label provided by the annotators.
      The label is one of the following:
			 3: very anxious  
			 2: moderately anxious   
			 1: slightly anxious   
			 0: not associated with feeling anxious or calm
			-1: slightly calm
			-2: moderately calm
			-3: very calm
      We do not recommend using this label. It is provided just for information.
      Instead use either the mean or ordinalClass.

MajorityLabelRatio: Ratio of the number of annotators that provided the majority label to
      the total number of annotators that provided a response for the term.

NumberAnnotations: the total number of annotators that provided a response for the term.

SetOfLabels: A comma-separated list of the individual responses provided by the annotators.


2. Supplementary: This directory has additional supplementary data files.
      It curently includes the file highvariance-anxiety-annotations.txt which has a list of 500+
      terms not included in the main worrywords file, because there was considerable variance in
      their annotations. The file has the same format as worrywords-v1.txt.
      High variance can occur due to many reasons:
      -- not all words fit neatly in the calmness--anxiety dimension;
      -- different senses of a word may be associated with very different degrees of anxiety;
      -- occasional poor annotation; etc.
      It is generally tricky to use these entries; and often the main worrywords file should be 
      sufficient for most aggregate-level text analyses. However, entries from the highvariance
      file may also useful at times; best to exercise caution when using them.

ENCODING: The lexicon files were created using UTF-8 encoding. You can view the lexicon files using
most text editors, Microsoft Excel, etc. You might have to make sure that the viewer
supports characters from various languages, i.e., set the encoding option in the viewer to
UTF-8, etc.  For example, to view in excel, follow these steps:

- open excel
- click on File -> Import
- select file type as 'Text file'
- select the lexicon file to import in the dialog box that opens up
- select 'File Origin' type as 'Unicode (UTF-8)'
- click 'Finish'

X. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
-------------------------

Please see the papers below (included with the download) for ethical considerations
involved in automatic emotion detection and the use of emotion lexicons. (These also act
as the Ethics and Data Statements for the lexicon.)

Note that the labels for words are *associations* (and not denotations). As noted in the
paper above, they are limited by when the dataset was annotated, by the people that
annotated them, historical perceptions, and biases. (See bullets c through h in the
paper). It is especially worth noting that identity terms, such as those referring to
groups of people may be particularly prone to inappropriate biases. Further, marginalized
groups have historically faced more negative perceptions.
