Musical elements also emerge, with comparisons made to the rhythmic beats of popular rap music or the melodies from household items like water filters, presenting the feedback as a blend of mechanical and musical sensations. Overall, the haptic feedback serves as a bridge between physical sensations and the emotional weight of personal memories and interactions."

There are also vivid comparisons to the exciting vibrations felt during childhood games, such as playing Beyblade or jumping in inflatable bouncers. On a more intense note, the feedback reminds them of heavy machinery like drilling machines, alarming sounds like car ignitions or sirens, and even the consistent hum of a chainsaw. The physical sensations are encapsulated further through metaphors related to nostalgia and urgency, such as the anticipation felt when using a Nintendo Switch or the discomfort of chalk on a blackboard and squeaky shoes in a classroom. This haptic signal thus intertwines levity and seriousness, creating a rich tapestry of emotional responses."
